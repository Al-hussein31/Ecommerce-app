## Overview

Hello,

I am thrilled to share the results of the E-commerce Web Application challenge that I undertook. This challenge pushed my boundaries, and I am excited to present a web application that showcases my newfound skills and abilities. Here's an overview of what I've accomplished:

## Project Details:

Objective: The goal of this challenge was to create a fully functional E-commerce Web Application using HTML, JavaScript, and Sass.

Key Features: The application includes the following key features:

Responsive Design: I ensured that the web app is responsive and optimally adjusts to different device screen sizes, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

Interactive Elements: I paid special attention to the user interface, implementing hover states for interactive elements to enhance user engagement.

Lightbox Gallery: Users can click on a product image to open a lightbox gallery, allowing them to view high-resolution images for a closer look at the product.

Thumbnail Image Switch: I enabled users to switch between different product images by clicking on small thumbnail images.

Shopping Cart: The app allows users to add items to their shopping cart with ease, simplifying the shopping process.

Cart Management: Users can view the contents of their cart and remove items as needed, providing a personalized shopping experience.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

During the development process, I encountered challenges and roadblocks that required creative problem-solving. This experience has enhanced my ability to troubleshoot and find effective solutions.

I gained a deeper understanding of responsive web design and the importance of user experience in e-commerce applications.

### Continued development

While this challenge was a great learning experience, there's always room for improvement. In the future, I plan to expand on this project by adding more advanced features such as user authentication, payment processing, and product reviews.

I am also eager to continue refining my coding skills and staying up-to-date with the latest web development technologies.
I want to continue learning JavaScript and I Want to increase my knowledge to React
